# Nasa Exoplanet Flights
A React + Node project to detect new exoplanets and allow a user to schedule a flight.
An exoplanet is a planet outside the earthâ€™s solar system with conditions favorable to life.

# Background
NASA used the Kepler telescope to collect astronomical data about exoplanets and starts, 
including the mass, temperature, and light received. In order for a planet to be habitable,
the light received needs to falls within an established range. Planets also cannot be too
large because larger planets tend to be made of gas instead of rock.

The application reads in a CSV file containing exoplanet data using the Stream API and 
stores the data in a MongoDB database.
